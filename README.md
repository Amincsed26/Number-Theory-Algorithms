This project includes implementations of key number theory algorithms: checking prime numbers using the Sieve of Eratosthenes, finding prime factors of integers, and computing the greatest common divisor (GCD) and least common multiple (LCM) through both the Euclidean algorithm and prime factorization. It also features an implementation of the Chinese Remainder Theorem.
